The First Python Selfbot for Slack Workspaces :star:

## What is this?

Slacky was created as way to automate and make Slack more fun to use. It comes with many commands by default and even allows for custom plugins to be built and imported easily.

Slack as far as I can see have no rules against using selfbots so the only people who would probably find this annoying/against policy would be your organizer admistrators.

### This README doesn't have all the info! I've written a readme with a bunch of info on the bot [here](https://github.com/M4cs/Slacky/wiki). Check it out for information on how to Install, Setup, and Customize Slacky!

### Read how to run the bot in multiple workspaces [here](https://github.com/M4cs/Slacky/wiki/Multiple-Workspaces)

## License

I ask that if you fork this do not release as your own. Please credit and mention it's built off this. In fact building a plugin pack rather than a new bot entirely would be best! The license is MIT so I won't stop you but I'm just asking that you respect my wishes :smile:
